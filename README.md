# qwentts-cpp-python

Python bindings and wheel packaging for Pascal's `qwentts.cpp` C ABI.

This package is intentionally small:

- it loads `libqwen` with `ctypes`
- it exposes buffered and streaming synthesis
- it can bundle prebuilt `libqwen`/`libggml` binaries in platform wheels
- it does not bundle GGUF model weights

CUDA development build with an existing `qwentts.cpp` checkout:

```bash
python scripts/build_native.py \
  --source /path/to/qwentts.cpp \
  --backend cuda \
  --clean
QWENTTS_CPP_WHEEL_BUILD_TAG=1cu128 python -m build --wheel
```

CPU development build:

```bash
python scripts/build_native.py \
  --source /path/to/qwentts.cpp \
  --backend cpu \
  --clean
QWENTTS_CPP_WHEEL_BUILD_TAG=1cpu python -m build --wheel
```

`--backend cuda` is the default because `faster-qwen3-tts` is a CUDA-first
package. CPU builds are still useful for development and smoke tests, but they
are not the primary release target.

The CI wheel build applies `patches/qwentts-cpu-host-prompt-projection.patch`
to the checked-out `qwentts.cpp` source. The patch keeps CUDA on the backend
projection path and routes CPU prompt projection through host F32 math, which is
required for the current upstream ref to produce valid CPU speech on aarch64.

`QWENTTS_CPP_WHEEL_BUILD_TAG` is useful for local wheelhouses. For public
indexes, publish one backend flavor per package/version/platform compatibility
tag; otherwise pip has no way to choose between CPU and CUDA binaries.

Local smoke test with a built library:

```bash
QWENTTS_CPP_LIBRARY=/path/to/libqwen.so python - <<'PY'
from qwentts_cpp import QwenLibrary
lib = QwenLibrary()
print(lib.version())
PY
```

Model files are resolved with `huggingface-hub` by `QwenTTS.from_pretrained(...)`
or passed directly to `QwenTTS(...)` as GGUF paths.
